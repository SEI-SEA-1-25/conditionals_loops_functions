// 1)
// Create a variable called dogName, set it to 'Violet'
var dogName = 'Violet'
    // if dogName is Violet, print "This is the best dog"
if (dogName === 'Violet') {
    console.log('This is the best dog');

} else {

}
// otherwise, if dogName is Moose, print "Also a very good dog"
// otherwise, print "All dogs are good"

// 2) If 5 is greater than 4, print "Math still works, what a relief"
// otherwise, print "The basic laws of math have failed us"
if (5 > 4) {
    console.log('Math still works, what a relief');

// 3) Create two variables, income and expenses, giving them whatever values you'd like.
// If income is greater than or equal to expenses, print "Budget is balanced", then print the amount of surplus
// Otherwise, print "Uh oh, budgeting problem", then print the amount of defecit
// Try embedding the surplus/defecit into the string you're printing! This can be done with string concatenation or string templating. Try it both ways. Google for examples if unsure.
// Change the values of income and expenses to force the other branch of the conditional to fire.

let income = 50;
let expenses = 25;
let surplus = income - expenses;
if (income >= expenses) {
    console.log(`Budget is balanced . it's ${surplus}`);
}

// 4) Create two variables, temp and raining. Set temp to a number and raining to a boolean.
// If temp is 72 or higher and raining is false, print 'Vacation time!'
// 4b) Consider all the outcomes of these two conditions, numbere 1 thru 4:
//                temp is 72 or higher?
//                yes   no
//                ___________
// raining?  yes | 1    2
//            no | 3    4
// Your conditional handles one of these outcomes. Build it out so that it handles all 4, printing something different in each case.
