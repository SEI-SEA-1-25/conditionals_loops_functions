// 1) Write a function called addOne that takes a number as an argument, adds 1 to it, and returns the result.
// Invoke this function, and assign it to a new variable. Print this variable.
let num = 0;

function addOne() {
    num += 1
    return num
}
console.log(num);

// 2) Write a function called addition that takes in two numbers, adds them together, and returns the result.
// Invoke this function, and assign it to a new variable. Print this variable.

// 3) Write a function called calculator that takes in three arguments: two numbers, and a string. If the string is '+', it should add them together; if the string is '-', subtract them, and so on for '*' and '/'. It should return the result of the calculation.
// Invoke this function, and assign it to a new variable. Print this variable.

// 4) Write a function called findMax that takes in an array of numbers and returns the highest number in the array.
// Invoke this function, and assign it to a new variable. Print this variable.

// 5) Write a function called addHype that takes in an array of strings. It should return an array of strings that are capitalized versions of the input strings. For example, it would turn ['violet', 'moose', 'hercules'] into ['VIOLET', 'MOOSE', 'HERCULES']
