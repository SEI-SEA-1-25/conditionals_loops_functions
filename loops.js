console.log("Hello from loops!")

// 1) Count to 10! Print the numbers between 1 and 10. Do this once with a for loop, then again with a while loop. Beware the infinite while loop!

// 2) Count from 20 to 100 in multiples of 5, one with a for loop and once with a while

// 3) Make an array that contains your 5 favorite foods, stored as strings. Loop through this array, and print "I love <food>!" for each one.

// 4) Create a variable called numbers that starts off as an empty array. Use a loop to push the numbers 1 through 5 into this array. You'll need to use the .push method of your array, google it!

// 5) Create a variable called squaredNumbers that starts off as an empty array. Loop through the numbers variable, and for each one, push that number squared into the squaredNumbers array. (To square a number, multiple it by itself!)
